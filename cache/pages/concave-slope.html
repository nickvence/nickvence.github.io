<p>One problem landscape developers (civil engineers) face is the need to have a hill
decline in elevation as rapidly as possible. While the construction of a retaining
wall is a last resort, an aesthetically-pleasing hillside is more desireable.</p>
<p>Before the growth of precision guidance system, the standard procedure was the creation of
a linear slope.  Unfotunately, a linear slope is not</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>optimized for a rapid elevation decline</p></li>
<li><p>optimized for errosion, and</p></li>
<li><p>aesthetically pleasing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The growth of precision autoguidance construction equipment allows for the creation
of slopes with a concave cross-section. Sokolovski described the optimal form of
these slopes as the solution to boundary value problems in the 1960s.
However, Isaac Jeldes, created an approximation to Sokolovski's boundary value problem
that was a simple integral.  He tested his approximation's integrity with a finite
element analysis scheme, and then asked me to help him justify approximation theoretically.
Read the paper for the full scoop, but if you're pressed for time, approximating
\[tan(x) \approx x\]</p>
