<p>I am a computational scientist who has been steeped in research.
However, being unsatisfied with the vagaries of grant-based funding,
I'm transitioning my career towards buisness intelligence, data science, applied statistics, etc.</p>
<div class="section" id="research">
<h1>Research</h1>
<p>I earned my PhD in computational atomic physics from the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.phys.utk.edu/">University of Tennessee</a>
running quantum mechanical simulations on what was temporarily one of the world's
largest computers at the <a class="reference external" href="https://jics.utk.edu">Joint Institute of Computational Sciences</a> located at
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ornl.gov/">Oak Ridge National Laboratories</a>.  During my first postdoc at <a class="reference external" href="https://devcell.bio.uci.edu/">University of California Irvine</a>,
I used using machine learning to identify the phases of stem cells using the shape of their DNA.
During my second postdoc at <a class="reference external" href="https://home.llu.edu/research">Loma Linda University</a>, I joined a translational research team
creating a proton radiation to improve medical imaging (creating a proton computed
tomography scanner) and pioneering radiosurgery using small animals models.
Later I joined a prosective dietary cohort (N=96,000) as a Data Analyst.</p>
<p>I enjoyed each of the projects. They were inspiring and I learned much from each group.
However, I began to realize a troubling trend (structural flaw) in the economics of
grant-funded research: funding growth does not match the growth of new researchers --
newly-minted PhDs like myself.</p>
<p>This imbalance means many groups run into funding snag where unexpected budget cuts
or the inability to secure additional grants means personel can no longer be supported.
Having identified the problem, I've decided to be part of the solution and remove myself
from the funding race.</p>

<h1>Why a statistics blog</h1>
<p>During my math undergrad and PhD in physics, I got taught myself a lot of math.
However, I managed to avoid completing a formal statistics course.
<a class="reference external" href="https://blog.doist.com/feynman-technique/">Richard Feynman</a> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1">1</a> said that teaching is the best way to learn something.
So in this blog, I'll be writing about interesting applications of probability and statistics.</p>
