<p class="sidebar-title">Diabetes biometrics</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin">Hemoglobin A1c</a> (HbA1c) is the standard biometric used to quantify the severity
of diabetes. It measures the fraction of red blood cells that have glucose
adsorbed. HbA1c can get worse quickly as more suger clings to the
hemoglobin; however, for HbA1c to get better, one must wait for the
affected blood cells to die and be replaced by better values.  HbA1c is
too insensitive for a 12 week intervention.</p>
<p>Two <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis">homeostatic</a> (steady-state internal conditions) alternatives provide
a more responsive diabetes biometric measuring digestive function as a
percentage of a healthy adult.
HOMA-Beta is a homeostatic measure of pancreatic beta cell function, and
HOMA-IR is a homeostatic measure of insulin resistance calculated
from fasting blood glucose and either blood insulin or C-peptide.
These biometrics are much more sensitve than HbA1c for they dynamically track
pancreatic and liver function.</p>
<p>We use HOMA-IR as our primary outcome to quantify diabetic severity.</p>
<p>Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (sBP and dBP) and weight were
secondary outcomes</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I'm involved in a 12 week, randomized control trial determining the
effectiveness of phone coaching on low-income diabetics.
One of our physician-advisors had difficulty understanding the following
figure which visualizes the range or our outcome variables.</p>
<div class="figure" style="width: 600px">
<img alt="Range of outcome variables." class="float-left" src="../files/pctChg_Outcomes_IQR.png" style="width: 600px;"><p class="caption"><strong>Figure 1</strong> The median of the percent change (from baseline)
of the outcome variables is marked by a point while the first
and third quartiles are visualized by verticle lines.</p>
</div>
<p>Our published physician wrote the following upon reviewing our manuscript:</p>
<div class="admonition admonition-physician-s-critique">
<p class="admonition-title">Physician's Critique</p>
<p>[I've] never seen quartiles shown as lines on such a graph before...
what is the utility? many or most readers will be confused.
Why show 1st &amp; 3rd quartiles instead of 1st &amp; 4th?
The p-values do not seem to correspond to the data shown,
but it is not clear to me whether the error bars are the range for the
quartiles or not, and what the mean or median for each quartile shown is.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title">Randomized Control Trial</p>
<p>In a randomized control trial, researchers hope their treatment
(phone coaching in our case) will confer some benefit on the participants.
This benefit is measured by an outcome variable.
If one of our outcome variables had a significantly different distribution
between the control and intervention group, we could claim that since the
only difference between the two groups was the presence of phone coaching,
phone coaching must be the cause of this difference.</p>
<p>When designing a randomized control trial, one must specify the primary
outcome at the beginning. Since we are interested in helping diabetics,
we chose an a measure of insulin resistance as our primary outcome.
However, if phone coaching also lead to weight loss, we would certainly
report it.</p>
</div>
<p>While <em>I</em> think this figure is clear, the customer is always right.
My job is to communicate these distributions
our audience (physicians) as clearly as possible.</p>
<p>The following tour showcases different visualization options to
understand the pros and cons of comparing the range of several continuous
variables between groups.</p>

<h3>The tour</h3>
<p>Our primary outcome, ΔHOMA-IR, is a slightly <strong>asymmetrical distribution</strong>
with <strong>outliers</strong>. The outliers come from patients with advanced-stage
diabetes who are in various stages of organ failure.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, our discussion below
will refering to the primary outcome: ΔHOMA-IR.</p>
<div class="section" id="interquartile-range">
<h4>Interquartile Range</h4>
<p>Robust statistics (the median and interquartile range) describe the inner
half of the distribution; the exclusion of the outliers is acceptable because
we are interested in how normal (not advanced-stage) diabetics are affected.
Notice the distributions' small dispersion; it is easy to see they are
different.  We also see a left-skew in the control group.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that this set of outcome variables have such a wide range of
dispersions, for it is difficult to see the narrow range of the weight
distribution.</p>

</div>
<p>When choosing a visualization, there is no substitute for looking at the
individual data points.  First, I notice the outliers (see Table 2).
They will inflate the standard deviation and potentially skew
(add asymmetry to) the distribution.
Next, I see that the intervention group is clustered by zero,
while the control group is more spread out. These distributions
<em>look</em> a little different. The secondary outcome variables
look the same; that is, they look like side-by-side clouds with
more or less the same center and width.</p>

<p>While looking at the raw data is a great way to compare the two
distributions, p-values answer the question of statistical
significance. At the study's outset the researcher determines the
level of significance (usually 0.05), which is the probability
that a random selection of points might give a result at least this different
from the initial distribution. Choosing a smaller signficance level makes
statistical significance harder to achieve, but squelches statistical flukes
from falsely claiming to be significant.</p>
<p>Quantitatively determining if two distributions are different is usually done with
the independent t-test.  However, in this study we wanted to control
for potential confounding factors (race, years of diabetes, income,
food access, and psychological stage of change); we used a multivariate
linear model and analyzed the p-value of Group (Intervention vs Control).</p>
<p>Our advisor said, "the p-values don't seem to correspond to the data shown."
In his defense, he only saw the median and IQR. Let's look at the actual
data points in Fig. 3 beginning with the distribution with the largest p-value:
diastolic Blood Presure (dBP). The data look like two identical side-by-side
clouds; this is different from the distribution in Fig. 1 where each
distribution appears to have a different skew. This apparent skew
is an artifact (non-realistic feature) that comes from excluding outliers.
For HOMA-Beta (p = .8), the difference between Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 is drastic:
dropping the outliers seems to skew the data in opposite directions. The data
points in Fig. 3 seem to have a similar center.  Perhaps, HbA1c and Weight
would have a larger p-value were it not for the single outlier. Finally,
looking at HOMA-IR, it is easy to see that the intervention
group has significantly more points clustered around zero. This is really
exactly what we were hoping: we wanted a statistically significant difference
in the distribution of our primary outcome. The small p-value (0.027) reflects
the fact that it is 97% likely that these numbers did not come from the same
distribution. There is 97% that phone coaching caused the distribution of the
intervention group's insulin resistance to be different than the distribution
of the control group's insulin resistance.  Therefore, phone coaching must work
at lowering diabetic's insulin resistance, which means our study is a success!</p>
<p>At first glance, each pair of outcomes seems to come from the same
distribution; however, several outliers (see Table 2) deserve some
attention. The HOMA variables have the largest dispersion, for
they depend on several factors: subject health, other body</p>

<div class="section" id="mean-and-standard-deviation">
<h4>Mean and Standard Deviation</h4>
<div class="figure align-right" style="width: 600px">
<img alt="Outcome variables plotted by mean and standard deviation" src="../files/pctChg_Outcomes_sd.png"><p class="caption"><strong>Figure 3</strong> Distribution of the percent change in each primary and
secondary outcome variable: the mean is marked by a point, and the
verticle line marks one standard deviation.</p>
</div>
<p>The mean and standard deviation (SD) are not robust statistics; that is,
they are highly influenced by outliers.
The control group’s mean (Fig 3) is about 2x larger than the median (Fig 1).
Similarly, the SD of the control group is about 4x larger than of the
intervention group (Fig 3). When looking at the actual data in Fig 2, however,
the spread while of the control group, while slightly larger, is primarily
driven by the outlier: a single data point. Should we trust this point as valid?
After all, an outlier in the wieght reported 38% weight loss in 15 weeks.
It is time to get some domain knowledge.</p>
<p>After showing this outlier to our physician-PI (principle investigator),
she said an HOMA-IR significantly less than 1.0 (see the first row of Table 2)
is a sign of organ failure which is common in advanced stages of diabetes.
Wow.  This is the perfect reason to exclude outliers. People with organ failure
should not be influencing our distribution!</p>

</div>
<p>Since medical knowledge tells us to exclude outliers from our distrbution,
the mean and SD are the wrong statistics.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="violin-plot">
<h4>Violin Plot</h4>
<p>The violin plot shows the distribution's density as an horizontal displacement
from the center.  It usually does an great job comparing distributions; however,
in this case the are such a range of distributions that the most disperse seem to
have no width becoming a vertical line, and the most compact are nearly a horizontal
line.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="box-plot">
<h4>Box Plot</h4>
<div class="figure align-right" style="width: 600px">
<img alt="Outcome variables plotted by mean and standard deviation" src="../files/pctChg_Outcomes_boxplot.png" style="width: 600px;"><p class="caption"><strong>Figure 5</strong> A box plot of the distribution of the percent change in each
primary and secondary outcome variable.</p>
</div>
<p>While the violin plot is aesthetically appealing, it lacks a certain rigor.
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey">John Tukey</a> pioneered the box plot which standardizes a distribution using
quantiles (robust statistics). The box extends from the Q1 up to Q3 and has
the median marked with a bold line. The height of the box is the interquartile
range (IQR), and any skew is visible the upper and lower half of the box is a
differnt size.
Vertical bars extend up to either the distribution's edge or 1.5 IQR, and any points
beyond 1.5 IQR are considered outliers and plotted individually.</p>
<p>Since our study is focusing on the main distribution, we choose to drop the outliers
as a more succinct visualization that doesn't invite criticism of the outliers.</p>

<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>One purpose of a visualization is to present a visual aggregate of the data.
Each of the first three figures has some artifact (an artificial defect that
doesn't match the original distribution). The artifact from the robust
statistics (see Fig. 1) is a false skew that occured upon removing the outer
half of the points from relatively small sample.</p>
<p>It seems that plotting the raw data would be the most honest, yet overplotting
hides the true shape of the data.
Jittering randomly displaces the x coordinate, but the randomness isn't uniform
and often distorts or hides the distribution.
Adding a translucence (not done) to each point is a method of revealing
hidden points.</p>
<p>The artifact of the mean and SD in a distribution with outliers is a systematic
bias skewing the mean and inflating the SD.</p>
<p>Adding a jitter and
increasing the transluscence of each point will partially restore the
misperception that occurs when viewing raw data.</p>
