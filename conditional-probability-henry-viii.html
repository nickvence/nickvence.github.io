<p class="sidebar-title">History</p>
<p>When Henry Tudor's brother died, Henry married his widow (<strong>Catherine
of Aragon</strong>) to preserve the alliance with Spain. While Catherine produced a <em>daughter</em>
(the future Bloody Mary), she did not produce a male heir - much to the constirnation
of the king and his advisors.  In persuit of his "great matter" Henry VIII married
six times.</p>
<p>First the beguiling <strong>Anne of Bolyn</strong> seduced the king, under her influence Henry broke
with the Roman Catholic church starting the church of England.  She produced
the future Elizabeth I yet no <em>male</em> heir.</p>
<p>One day after the execution of Anne, Henry got engaged with <strong>Jane Seymour</strong>, whom he
married nine days later. She soon gave birth the future Edward VI, and died in childbirth.</p>
<p>Henry's next wife, <strong>Anne of Cleves</strong>, was a long-distance relationship that was chosen,
in part for political reasons and partly because of an overly-flattering portrait.
The union was short, Henry called her, "that flanders mare," and Anne later confirmed
that the marriage was never consumated.</p>
<p>Henry soon became enchanted with the young energetic <strong>Catherine Howard</strong>. However, two years
later, when rumors of her involvement with other men were confirmed three more heads rolled.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine Parr</strong> was Henry's final wife. She helped him reconsile with his daughters Mary
ane Elizabeth and nursed him to his death.</p>

<p>This article analyzes conditional probablilty in the context of the six-player, asymmetric
board game <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gmtgames.com/p-508-here-i-stand-500th-anniversary-reprint-edition.aspx">Here I Stand</a> (HIS). Each player of HIS has a special way to earn victory points.
For instance, the English player gets 5 Victory Points (VP) upon produicing a male heir.
Since the first player to 25 VP wins, there is substantial incentive for England to secure the
succession.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII"><img alt="/files/HenryVIII.png" class="align-left" src="files/HenryVIII.png" style="width: 300px;"></a>
<p>After playing his home card to persue a wife, the English player rolls a (six-sided) die
and consults the Henry's wives' pregnancy chart to see if any children (VP) are born.
The English player might be interested in the probability of acquiring a male heir
based on the number of rolls.  Mathematically, this is the cumulative probability distribution
and its calculation is the subject of this article.</p>
<p>HIS captures this drama, by awarding the English player special victory points based
on his progeny. Once per turn (HIS has only nine turns), the English player may play his
home card to roll a six-sided dice whose results are determined by the following table.</p>

<h3>Probability</h3>
<p>This problem becomes easier to discuss when we use the right notation.
Let's review some probability theory:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Sample space, sample point, event, random variable, complement.</p></li>
<li><p>Conditional probability.</p></li>
<li><p>A partition.</p></li>
<li><p>The probability of an event E conditional on a partition.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>sample space</strong> $\Omega$ is the set of all possible outcomes; these outcomes must be
mutually exclusive (non-overlapping) and exhaustive (nothing that can happen is left out).
The elements of the sample space are the called <strong>sample points</strong> $\omega$.
The sample space is the collection of dice rolls needed for a player to win.
Here are some sample points (⚄), (⚁,⚅).
Notice that (⚄,⚅) is not in the sample space, because one doesn't continue rolling after you win.
Notice that the <strong>event</strong> of winning on the first roll, $E_1$, contains two sample points: (⚄), (⚅).</p>
<p>The probability of event A is written
$$P(A) = N_A/N_{total}$$
where $N_A$ is the number of sample points in A and $N_{total}$ is the total sample points.
For example, if event A is rolling a 3 on a pair of dice,
then there are 36 elements in the sample space, and two sample points (⚀,⚁) and (⚁,⚀) correspond
to a three; thus, $N_A = 2$, $N_{total} = 36$, and $P(A) = 1/18$.</p>

<strong>Table 1</strong>  P(start), the probability of getting to Roll 1, is certain: if you start the game,you can make the first roll. $E_1$ is the event of winning on the first roll.$P(E_1|start)$, the probability of winning on the first roll given we have started,is equal to $P(E_1) P(start)$.</caption>

<p>Henry VIII was interested in producing a male heir, so let $E_1$ be winning on Roll 1.
This happens by rolling a ⚄ ⚅; therefore, the probability of a male heir
being born is $2/6 = 0.333$.
The probability of getting to this roll <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="conditional-probability-henry-viii.html#id3" id="id1">1</a>, which is 100%; therefore, $P(A) = 1$.</p>
<p>The probability that event $E$ does not happen is
$$
P(!E) = 1 - P(E)
$$
The probability of getting to Roll 2 is the probability that
we do not win on Roll 1: 1 - 2/6 = 0.667.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="roll-2">
<h3>Roll 2</h3>
<p>The game has two rules that make calculating Roll 2 more difficult.
First, there is a rule that when a player rerolls a number, he is awarded the next-highest number.
Second, Jane Seymour (the second queen) gets +1 added to her roll since she was the mother of Edward VI.
This modification accounts for the + in the first row of Table 0.</p>

<p>For simplicity, let's first calculate our probabilities without the Jane Seymore rule.
There are three ways to win on Roll 2:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Roll 1 is ⚀ - ⚃ and Roll 2 is ⚅</p></li>
<li><p>Roll 1 is ⚀ - ⚃ and Roll 2 is ⚄</p></li>
<li><p>Roll 1 is ⚃ and Roll 2 is ⚃.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, thanks to +1 conferred by Jane Seymore the following paths all lead to a win:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Roll 1 is ⚀ - ⚃ and Roll 2 is ⚅</p></li>
<li><p>Roll 1 is ⚀ - ⚃ and Roll 2 is ⚄</p></li>
<li><p>Roll 1 is ⚀ - ⚃ and Roll 2 is ⚃</p></li>
<li><p>Roll 1 is ⚃ and Roll 2 is ⚂.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We compress the first three bullets into the first row of Table 2,
and the fourth bullet gets the second row.
One way of thinking about how to calculate the probability is to
visualize a grid of the 36-element sample space of two dice.
There are four ways (prob = 4/6) to get to this row from Roll 1,
and three ways to win on Roll 2 (prob = 3/6).
The probability of both these independent events happening is the
product of these two probabilities: 4/6 * 3/6 = 12/36.</p>

<p>The second row of Table 2 is much more rare; only one of the
36 sample points corresponding to this event.
Calculating the probability of row 2 is done by recognizing that one out of 36 corresponds to 1/36,
or multiplyting the probability of the independent events: P(⚃) * P(⚂) = 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36.</p>
<p>The probability of winning on the second roll is the combination of these two disjoint events.
$P(2) = (12 + 1)/36 = 0.361$.</p>
<p>Being able to visualize the entire sample space is intuitive, but as things get more complicated,
we need to develop the conditional probability formalism to deal with these doubles rule.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conditional-probability">
<h3>Conditional Probability</h3>
<p>Let's take a moment to learn about conditional probability of event B given that event A has occured
$$
P(B|A) = \frac{P(B \cap A)}{P(A)}
$$
where $P(B|A)$ is read "the probability of B given A," and $P(B \cap A)$ <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="conditional-probability-henry-viii.html#id4" id="id2">2</a> is the probability that
both A and B have occured. Rearranging yields
$$
P(B \cap A) = P(A) P(B|A).
$$</p>
<p>Let's apply this formalism to Roll 2
$$
P(E_2) = P(E_2 \cap !E_1) = P(E_2) P(!E_1) = P(E_2) \big(1 - P(E_1)\big)
$$
The probability of winning on Roll 2 is the probability of winning at Roll 2 <em>and</em> we did not
win Roll 1. This is not having won Roll 1: $P(!E_1) = 1 - P(E_1) = 1 - 2/6 = 0.667$.</p>
<p>The second term, $P(E_2|!E_1)$ is the probability of winning <em>on Roll 2</em>
given that we didn't win roll 1. As outlined above, this can happen four independent ways;
each can be viewed as the probability of getting to Roll 2 times the probability of winning on Roll 2.</p>
<p>The coulumn $P(A)$ in each table is the probability of getting to this roll's win.</p>
<p>For each roll, let event B represent success on this roll and let event A represent
the probability of getting to this roll; that is, not having won on any of the previous rolls.
The probability of getting to the next roll is the probability of not winning this roll:
$$
P(\text{get to next}) = P(\text{not win this roll}) = 1 - P(\text{win|got to this roll})
$$
On Roll 2, we are going to unpack the conditional probability formula.</p>
