I am a computational scientist who has been steeped in research.
However, being unsatisfied with the vagaries of grant-based funding,
I'm transitioning my career towards business intelligence, data science, applied statistics, etc.

--------
Research
--------
I earned my PhD in computational atomic physics from the `University of Tennessee`_
running quantum mechanical simulations on what was at the time one of the world's
largest computers at the `Joint Institute of Computational Sciences`_ located at
`Oak Ridge National Laboratories`_.  During my first postdoc at `University of California Irvine`_,
I used using machine learning to identify the phases of stem cells using the shape of their DNA.
During my second postdoc at `Loma Linda University`_, I joined a translational research team
creating a proton computed tomography scanner 
and pioneering radiosurgery using small animals models, both to improve treatment on cancer patients).
Later, I joined a prosective nutritional epidemiology study (N=96,000) as a statistical programmer.

I enjoyed each project; they were inspiring and I learned much from each group.
However, I began to realize a troubling trend (structural flaw) in the economics of 
grant-funded research: funding growth does not match the growth of new researchers -- 
newly-minted PhDs like myself.

This imbalance means groups periodically experience funding lapses where unexpected budget cuts 
or a grant shortage means personnel can no longer be supported.
[IMPOROVE] Having identified the problem, I've decided to be part of the solution by removing myself
from the funding race by working for business supported by consumer demand.

Why a statistics blog
---------------------
IMPROVE During my math undergrad and PhD in physics, I taught myself a lot of math.
However, I never took a formal statistics course.
`Richard Feynman`_ said that teaching is the best way to learn something.
So in this blog, I'll be writing about interesting applications of probability and statistics.
