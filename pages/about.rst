I've always been a curious. Learning about the world's people and complexities.

People
------

Enjoying and understanding people: life's reward and challenge. 

Teaching those who want to learn is one of life' most rewarding endeavers.
I've taught and enjoyed teaching high school, community college, and university-level
physics. As I learn something, I try to improve upon the instruction I've received. 

I enjoy learning from people I meet.

Games are a great way to learn more about friends. 

I often find myself as social coordinator.

If you are not actively involved leading in your local church, you are missing out.

Music
-----
My parents gave me **piano** lessons as a child, and I picked up the instrument
during my year abroad as high school teacher in the island of Yap, Micronesia.

At summer camp, where I spent ten summers working, I learned to play the **guitar**
by ear.  I took **trombone** lessons in high school, and enjoyed playing in the school band.

The difference in sight reading and playing music by ear was striking;
they use opposite sides of the brain. I took the first **music theory**
with the hope of reconciling these differences, and I was pleased to
learn solfage (sight-singin), figured bass, and functional notation
which helped me annotate sheet music in a key-independent way.

One day, as I was visiting our departmental secretary, I noticed a
mystical looking blue-glazed, hollow, potato-lookin instrument 
sitting on his desk. When I asked him what this enchanting object
was, he told me it was an ocarina from Zelda. After tooting a few
notes, I fell in love and ordered my own **ocarina** and taught 
myself to play.

Finally, I enjoy **singing**:

- congregational singing at church,
- leading song service with a guitar, or
- joining a choir or ensemble.
