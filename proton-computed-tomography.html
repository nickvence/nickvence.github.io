<h3>Motivation</h3>
<div class="figure align-right" style="width: 450px">
<img alt="Comparing radiation-depth profiles: protons, x-rays, carbon" src="files/bragg.png" style="width: 400px;"><p class="caption"><strong>Fig. 1</strong> The radiation depth profile.
X-rays decay exponentially with depth.
Protons deposit most of their energy just before stopping at the Bragg Peak.
Carbon ions have less entry radiation and a sharper Bragg peak, but
the damage they do behind the Bragg peak limits their usefulness.</p>
</div>
<p class="lead">Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the Western world.
While surgery and chemotherapy can cure patients, these treatments
are often augmented with radiation.
Radiation onocologists have several radiation modalities to choose from.</p>
<p><em>X-rays</em> are the easiest to produce making thme the inexpensive choice; however,
their radiation damage profile is exponential with depth (see Fig. 1).
That is, they deposit most of their radiation near the surface.
Thus, physicians must spread out radiation delivery to give the tumor
the largest dose without burning the skin.</p>
<p><em>Protons</em> deliver the most tissue damage just before they stop; this is
called the Bragg peak (see Fig. 1).
The Bragg peak makes proton radiation a useful tool in treating
of head and neck tumors which are often surrounded by vital organs.
For these situations, minimizing the treatment volume is
often the difference between treatment and no treatment:
the difference between life and death.</p>
<p>Proton Computed Tomography (pCT) will offer two unique advantages to
patients getting treated with proton radiation.
The first advantage, is simple: pCT gives a lower radiation dose
than that of x-ray Computed Tomography (xCT); however, the primary
advantage can be life saving.</p>
<p>To understand the primary advantage, it helps to know that
radiation treatment planning requires a 3D image of the tumor,
and currently, the only option is an xCT.
It is probably not surprising that x-rays (whch are photons) stop
differently than protons (heavy, sub-atomic particles).
The stopping-power difference is unfortunate because it means the
3D image (of x-ray stopping power) produced by the xCT is an ambiguous map
for the stopping power of a proton.
This translates into an increased margin of error for the depth of the protons
which translates into a larger treatment-volume.</p>
<p>To avoid relapse in the cancer that caused the tumor,
doctors apply a margin of error around the tumor to
be sure its undetected tenticles are destroyed. For tumors far
from vital organs, this acceptable: the body will
recover from the radiation damage. However, tumors in the head
and neck are often located too close to vital organ; that is,
there is no room for doctors to prescribe the appropriate radiation
margin.  Unfortunately, these patients are denied treatment.</p>
<p>By eliminating the differential stopping power between xCT and pCT,
phycisians will be able to perscribe smaller tumor margins. This means
all patients will receive lower radiation dose, and
fewer patients will be denied treatment.</p>

<h3>The Scanner</h3>
<div class="figure align-right" style="width: 400px">
<img alt="The proton Computed Tomography scanner." src="files/pct3.png" style="width: 400px;"><p class="caption"><strong>Fig. 2</strong> (Upper) Photo of the phase 2 proton Computed Tomography scanner.
(Lower) A representative proton path traveling through the forward position detector,
head-phantom, rear position detector, and into the energy detector of the phase 1 scanner.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure align-right" style="width: 400px">
<img alt="Calibration phantom" src="files/callibration.png" style="width: 400px;"><p class="caption"><strong>Fig. 3</strong> The calibration phantom (orange) is shown between the tracker planes
(and in the inset). The proton's final destination is the numbered, yellow,
scintillating energy detectors.</p>
</div>
<p>The pCT scanner consists of two parts:
the proton energy detector and the proton tracker.</p>
<p>The tracker is a silicon strip detector (SSD) charged with a moderate voltage.
When hit by a proton, scattered electrons flow down the strips and register the coordinate.
A position requires x and y coordinate, and two positions are needed to record the angle.
Thus, to measure the incoming and outgoing angle, the proton must pass through eight SSD detectors.</p>
<p>As the proton breaks to a stop, the scintillating energy detector gives off light.
The proton stops in a series of five Cesium-Iodide (CsI) crystals.
Each are wrapped in reflective tape and connected to photomultiplier tubes whose signal
is processed to determine the proton's energy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="energy-callibration">
<h3>Energy Callibration</h3>
<p>I worked with the callibration of the energy detector
which involved the following steps:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Create low-intensity proton beam.</p></li>
<li><p>Take data with calibration phantom (see Fig. 3).</p></li>
<li><p>Reconstruct proton path from tracker data.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the distance traveled in the calibration phantom.</p></li>
<li><p>Correlate this distance to light output.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For calibration, we need a low-intensity proton beam so that we are predomenantly measuring
single proton events.</p>
<p>The calibration phantom shown in Fig. 3 was designed to spread uniformly energetic protons
into energies that may be predicted by their path.
A stepped triangular prism provides an surface on which error in the tracker will not greatly
affect the detector path length.
The tracker phantom has four removable blocks which allow us to create protons
with energies across our detectable range.</p>
<p>The reconstruction of the proton path turns detector data into an entrance and exit ray.
A proton event is eight SSD coordinants and the light output of the five energy detectors.
First, tracker data is transformed from SSD strip number into detector coordinates.
Periodically the incoming and outgoing rays would be misaligned, these events are attributed
to proton scattering and disgarded.
The reconstruction of the remaining nearly-colinear rays, was an advanced algebra I problem.</p>
<p>The next step was finding the intersection of this geometric path with the
calibration phantom, and convert it into the standard unit of stopping power:
the Water Equivalent Path Length (WEPL).  Determining this intersection was tedious
given the intricate triangular steps of the calibration phantom.</p>
<p>Because a proton deposits the maximum energy just before stopping (the Bragg peak),
we gain maximize the precision of our energy measurement by calibrating with the light
from the deepest crystal that contains the Bragg peak.</p>

<h3>pCT scanners</h3>
<p>Reinhard Schulte, our project's principle investigator, created the phase 0 scanner
to include in his R01 grant application; it was made from spare parts and was added to imporve
the chances of his grant success. It worked; this proof of concept convinced
the grant comittee of the project's viability.</p>
<p>Much more care and engineering went into the design of the phase 1 scanner.
However, it was charactirized by its data acquisition bottleneck, and scans took between five and six hours.
One can imagine how difficult this ordeal would be for a human receiving such a scan.</p>
<p>Among the many improvements in the phase 2 scanner was a series of custom designed
integrated circuits to process current bursts from individual proton events on a single chip.
This allowed us to take data at about 1 MHz which reduced the total scan time to between
five and ten minutes.</p>
