<p>Partial differential equations (PDE) are used to approximate solutions to a variety of
real world problems.
MADNESS (Multiresolution ADaptive Numerical Environment for Scientific Simulation) is
a framework written in C++ for solving differential (and integral) equations efficiently
on high performance computers (HPC).</p>
<p>A first step to learning MADNESS is understanding the most popular model for solving PDEs:
the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method">finite element method</a> scheme which discretizes space (dividing it into boxes) and then
creates functions and operators to approximate the solution on the mesh (the discretized space).
While this popular approach works for a wide variety of problems, it breaks down for
high-dimensional problems that requires resolution at multiple length-scales.</p>

<p>As a practical example, suppose you are interested in modeling
three dimensional (3D) water waves on a finite element grid. DEFINE BOX as ELEMENT
Now suppose you need to include the interaction of the large ocean waves with the
small waves of an outboard motor; this is a problem with multiple length scales.
Large waves require a large total simulation volume, while small waves require a tiny volume units.
This combination uses lots of memory, and will scale poorly when increasing the resolution.
The memory footprint is proportional to the total number of boxes or elements <span class="math">\(N_{total}\)</span>, for</p>
<p>\[\text{Memory size} = O(N_{side}^3). \]</p>
<p>A high-dimensional, high-resolution problem is the weakness of the finite element method.
When possible, it is advantagous to use the fewest number of dimensions that adequately
capture the phenomenon. For instance, given a spherically symmetric electron cloud in the
presence of a linearly-polarized electric field, cylindrical symmetry is imposed on the
system. This makes a 2D simulation is sufficient; an elliptically-polarized laser,
however, breaks the cylindrical symmetry requiring a 3D simulation.</p>
<p>1D and most 2D problems can be solved on personal computers; however, when increasing
complexity outpaces the abilities of a personal computer, small workstations (or cloud
computing) are the next solution.  These use multiple of processors (with dozens
of computing cores) and can be built with over 100 GB of shared memory. In shared memory
computers, memory size (or processing power) is the bottleneck.
However, some simulations (supernova, weather, molecular dynamics, etc.) require the
largest computers, and these use distributed memory.
In these systems, interprocessor communication becomes the bottleneck.
While supercomputers will always be improving bus speeds, fiber optic interconnects,
network topology, and routing algorithms; users must create code to take advantage of
these technologies.</p>

<h3>MADness: a Multiresolution ADaptive mesh</h3>

<img alt="A multiresolution mesh" src="../files/madness1.png" style="width: 300px;"><p class="caption"><strong>Fig. 2</strong> A multiresolution mesh has more than one size box in the grid,
and an adaptive grid places extra grid points just where they are needed.</p>
</div>
<p>One way of solving the issue of multiple length-scales on a high-dimensional
domain is to introduce a multiresolution (variable-size) mesh
shown in Fig. 2.  Multiresolution is the M in the MADNESS acronym.</p>
<p>Multiresolution grid placement is challenge: will small ripples
stay in one place or will they move over time?
To solve this issue, MADNESS uses an ADaptive (mADness) mesh:
one that changes to meet the needs of the function being modeled. If you're
interested in the mathematical details of adaptive refinement, see section 2.1

<h3>madNESS: a Numerical Environment for Scientific Simulation</h3>
<p>This numerical environment for scientific simulation (madNESS) consists of the following
features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A library of fast, arbitrarily-accurate math functions acting on simulation-domain functions.</p></li>
<li><p>The illusion of "basis-free" computing.</p></li>

<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title">Case Study</p>
<p class="sidebar-subtitle">Poorly-designed software</p>
<p>In the early days, much was learned about engineering HPC applications by trial and error.
For instance, when writing a 3D finite element algorithm on a 64 CPU-cluster,
one might naively allocate 1 CPU for each element of a 4x4x4 grid (see Fig. 1).
This poor design-choice locks the hardware to the simulation-parameters,
limiting code portability and a future growth in computing power: <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law">Moore's Law</a>.</p>
<p>Many HPC applications are writen by scientists working outside their domain of expertice.
Over the years HPC frameworks have evolved to ease the transition, and MADNESS
has had the benefit of standing on the shoulders of giants.
One such luxury is having computational objects
that directly correspond to terms in the equation we are modeling.
Other HPC frameworks, by contrast, force programers to work with computational
objects that are non-physical abstractions (e.g. processorID).
These hurdles make HPC development needlessly complex.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hpc-api">
<h4>HPC API</h4>
<p>A 3D finite-element scheme stores the data of the simulation function
(ocean waves, or electron wave function) in a fixed, 3D array.
MADNESS functions, due to their adaptive nature are stored as a tree.
To facilitate fast, guaranteed precision math on this tree,
MADNESS provides an application programming interface (API)
for common operations for functions of one to six dimensions.
These operations include: arithmetic, linear algebra, numerical
differentiation, and integral convolution.
This API enables the creation of code that often reads like the
math equation that it is modeling. For an example see section 3 of the <a class="reference external" href="https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/beylkin/papers/H-B-B-C-F-F-G-etc-2016.pdf">SIAM publication</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="basis-free-computing">
<h4>"Basis-free" computing</h4>
<p>Many simple chemical systems are efficiently modeled using a molecular-orbit basis.
These basis functions reflect the symmetry of the system, and chemical processes near the
ground state are accurately described with just a few molecular-orbital basis functions.
This is referred to as a sparse basis, and is computationally beneficiais computationally beneficial</p>
<p>While a sparse basis makes for efficient computation, it has a dark side: basis error.
For low-energy processes (between the ground state and first excited state), the
basis error is small. However, as higher-energy chemical processes involve
more exotic excitations more basis functions are requred which amplifies
basis error. For these systems, MADNESS (like a finite element scheme)
becomes an attractive solution that doesn't have basis error.
However, being more memory-efficient, MADNESS outperforms the finite elements scheme
which is seen as a dense solution to the problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="load-balancing">
<h4>Load-balancing</h4>
<p>There are physical limits on processor speed;
for this reason, HPC is synonymous with distributed computing.
Today, the most powerful computers have the most processors.
Computers with thousands of available processors are no longer rare at universities and government labs.
However, writing efficient code to make use of these computers is a challenge.</p>
<p>An important test for HPC software is the <strong>scaling test</strong>: benchmarking
code speed as a function of the number of processors on which it is run.
Creating code whose speed scales linearly with the number of processors is the main goal in HPC.
IMPROVE SENTENCE Scaling measures the efficiency of processor use.  While more processors usually brings more speed,
in reality the law of diminishing returns eventually takes over.</p>
<p>MADNESS successfully scales to thousands of processors;
this is due in part to its internal compartmentalization of work for
its task-queue that is designed to hide interprocessor communication latency.
To learn more about the task queue read section 4 of the <a class="reference external" href="https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/beylkin/papers/H-B-B-C-F-F-G-etc-2016.pdf">SIAM publication</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hpc-libraries">
<h4>HPC Libraries</h4>
<p>Creating code that can take advantage of modern supercomputers can be a career.
Unfortunately, most scientists already have a career, and can't afford to put it
on hold while mastering distributed computing software development.
The following technologies allow average programmers (through MADNESS)
to leverage industry standard:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Global Arrays</strong> an API for shared memory programming on distributed memory computers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MPI</strong> Message Passing Interface for distributed-memory parallel programming.</p></li>

<h3>Background</h3>
<div class="figure align-right" style="width: 450px">
<img alt="Comparing radiation-depth profiles: protons, x-rays, carbon" src="../files/bragg.png" style="width: 400px;"><p class="caption"><strong>Fig. 1</strong> The radiation depth profile.
X-rays decay exponentially with depth.
Protons deposit most of their energy just before stopping at the Bragg Peak.
Carbon ions have less entry radiation and a sharper Bragg peak, but
the damage they do behind the Bragg peak limits their usefulness.</p>
</div>
<p class="lead">Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the Western world.
While surgery and chemotherapy can cure patients, these treatments
are often augmented with radiation.
Two of the common radiation modalities onocologists to choose from are x-rays and proton therapy.</p>
<p><em>X-rays</em> are the easiest to produce, making them the inexpensive choice; however,
their radiation damage profile is exponential with depth (see Fig. 1).
That is, they deposit most of their radiation near the surface.
Thus, physicians must spread out radiation delivery to give the tumor
the largest dose without burning the skin.</p>
<p><em>Protons</em> deliver the most tissue damage just before they stop; this is
called the Bragg peak (see Fig. 1).
The Bragg peak makes proton radiation a useful tool in treating
head and neck tumors which are often surrounded by vital organs.
For these situations, minimizing the treatment volume is
often the difference between treatment and no treatment:
the difference between life and death.</p>
<p>Proton Computed Tomography (pCT) will offer two unique advantages to
patients getting treated with proton radiation.
The first advantage is simple: pCT gives a lower radiation dose
than that of x-ray Computed Tomography (xCT); however, this not the primary
advantage.</p>
<p>To understand the primary advantage, it helps to know that
radiation treatment planning requires a 3D image of the tumor,
and currently, the only option is an xCT.
It is probably not surprising that x-rays (which are photons) stop
differently than protons (heavy, sub-atomic particles).
This stopping-power difference is unfortunate because it means the
3D image (of x-ray stopping power) produced by the xCT is an ambiguous map
for the stopping power of proton radiation.
This translates into an increased margin of error for the depth of the protons
which creates a larger treatment-volume. In the case of space-restricted tumors
in the head and neck.</p>
<p>To avoid relapse in the cancer that caused the tumor,
doctors apply a margin of error around the tumor to
be sure its undetected SPELL tenticles are destroyed. For tumors far
from vital organs, this acceptable: the body will
recover from the radiation damage. However, tumors in the head
and neck are often located too close to vital organs; that is,
there is no room for doctors to prescribe the appropriate radiation
margin.  Unfortunately, these patients are denied treatment.</p>
<p>By eliminating the differential stopping power between xCT and pCT,
oncologists will be able to perscribe smaller tumor margins. This means
all patients will receive a lower radiation dose, and
fewer patients will be denied treatment.</p>

<h3>The Scanner</h3>
<div class="figure align-right" style="width: 400px">

<img alt="Calibration phantom" src="../files/callibration.png" style="width: 400px;"><p class="caption"><strong>Fig. 3</strong> The calibration phantom (orange) is shown between the tracker planes
(and in the inset). The proton's final destination is the numbered, yellow,
scintillating energy detectors.</p>
</div>
<p>The pCT scanner consists of two parts:
the proton energy detector and the proton tracker.</p>
<p>The tracker is a silicon strip detector (SSD) charged with a moderate voltage. EXPLAIN BETTER
When hit by a proton, scattered electrons flow down the strips and registering the coordinate.
A position requires an x and y coordinate, and two positions are needed to record an angle.
Thus, to measure the incoming and outgoing angle, the proton must pass through eight SSD detectors.</p>
<p>As the proton brakes to a stop, the scintillating energy detector gives off light.
The proton stops in a series of five cesium-iodide (CsI) crystals.
Each are wrapped in reflective tape and connected to photomultiplier tubes whose signal
is processed to determine the proton's energy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="energy-calibration">
<h3>Energy Calibration</h3>
<p>I worked with the calibration of the energy detector
which involved the following steps:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Create low-intensity proton beam.</p></li>
<li><p>Take data with calibration phantom (see Fig. 3).</p></li>
<li><p>Reconstruct proton path from tracker data.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the distance traveled in the calibration phantom.</p></li>
<li><p>Correlate this distance to light output.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For calibration, we need a low-intensity proton beam so that we are SPELL predominantly measuring
single-proton events.</p>
<p>The calibration phantom shown in Fig. 3 was designed to spread uniformly energetic protons
into energies that may be predicted by their path.
A stepped triangular prism provides an surface on which error in the tracker will not greatly
affect the detector path length.
The tracker phantom has four removable blocks which allow us to create protons
with energies across our detectable range.</p>
<p>The reconstruction of the proton path turns detector data into an entrance and exit ray.
A proton event is eight SSD coordinants and the light output of the five energy detectors.
First, tracker data is transformed from SSD strip number into detector coordinates SPELL.
Periodically the incoming and outgoing rays would be misaligned, these events are attributed
to proton scattering and discarded.
The reconstruction of the remaining nearly-collinear rays, was solved to a series of linear equations.</p>
<p>The next step was finding the intersection of this geometric path with the
calibration phantom, and converting it into the standard unit of stopping power:
the water equivalent path length (WEPL).  Determining this intersection was tedious,
given the intricate triangular steps of the calibration phantom.</p>
<p>Because a proton deposits the maximum energy just before stopping (the Bragg peak),
we maximize the precision of our energy measurement by calibrating with the light
from the deepest crystal that contains the Bragg peak. IMPROVE</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>REMOVE
Reinhard Schulte, our project's principle investigator, created the phase 0 scanner
to include in his R01 grant application; it was made from spare parts and was added to improve
the chances of his grant success. It worked; this proof of concept convinced
the grant comittee of the project's viability. NOT NECESSARY</p>
<p>COMBINE
Much more care and engineering went into the design of the phase 1 scanner.
However, it was charactirized by its data acquisition bottleneck, and scans took between five and six hours.
One can imagine how difficult this ordeal would be for a human receiving such a scan.</p>
<p>Among the many improvements in the phase 2 scanner was a series of custom designed
integrated circuits to process current bursts from individual proton events on a single chip.
This allowed us to take data at about 1 MHz which reduced the total scan time to between
five and ten minutes.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhythmia">Cardiac arrhythmia</a> is a deadly condition in which one's heart beat becomes
irregular and results in oxygen deprivation.  The current treatment for atrial
fibrilation (a type of cardiac arrhythmia) is cauterizing (burning) part of the
heart so that scar tissue will electrically isolate the tissue generating the spurious
electrical impulse.</p>
<p>Knowing that proton radiation kills cells and creates scar tissue, our research team
was designing a non-invasive proton radiation treatment.
I joined this project during the dose-finding portion of the study.
We used a rat model to determine the radiation dose required to scar cardiac tissue.
The treatment was to target the sinoatrial node, the heart's "spark plug,"
with radiation.  To detect the development of scar
tissue in the sinoatrial node we relied on an electro-cardiogram (ECG).</p>
<p>The animal procedure was :</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>sedating the rat,</p></li>
<li><p>giving the rat a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan">CT-scan</a> (3D x-ray),</p></li>
<li><p>planning a two-beam proton radiation treatment,</p></li>
<li><p>administering proton radiation, and</p></li>
<li><p>monitoring the heart for signs of scarring in the weeks that followed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For the first step, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.llu.edu/pages/faculty/directory/faculty.html?eid=1a34670">Ying Nie</a>, our fearless biologist, placed the conscious rat in an
anesthesia box before comfortably securing the sedated rat in the half-pipe anesthesia cradle that
would carry it for the duration of the experiment (see Fig. 1 upper).</p>
<p>The second step was administering a chest <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan">CT-scan</a> to the rodent; the resulting 3D image
gives our radiation specialist the information to create a two-beam radiation treatment plan.
For a successful chest scan, the x-ray radiation must be gated (paused) during breathing to keep
the exposure from blurring during chest movement.
On human subjects, a box with reflective dots is placed on their chest and the CT-scanner
registers its movement with a video feed. Unfortunately, this setup didn't work, because
rats are too small, their breathing amplitude is too shallow, and were pointing away from the camera.</p>
<p>Our solution was to use a pressure sensor to measure the rat's breathing and artifically
move the reflective box to interface with the CT scanner's existing video recognition system.
The BIOPAC pressure sensor (Fig. 1 lower) output a 10 Volt DC analog signal, and
I programmed an Arduino Uno to convert this to a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">pulse width modulation</a> signal driving the
servo motor which moved the reflective box.  The first video gives an overview, and the second video
shows it in action.</p>

<p>While the treatment plan (step three) was being created, I measured the spatial offset in the
gantry <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="../radiosurgery.html#id2" id="id1">1</a> using proton-sensitive film.  Then we performed step four: fixing the rat on the table,
dialing in the offset, and administering the prescribed radiation dose.</p>
<p>The final step took place over the following weeks as a cardiologist monitored the rat's ECG
for aberrations caused by scar tissue forming in the heart.</p>

<p>Stem cells are interesting because they can divide and specialize.
Control of stem cell development holds the promise of engineering new organs.
While the use of human stem cells in research is fraught with ethical complications,
<em>`C. elegans`_</em> worms are small, translucent and have a short life span
making them ideal models for studying stem cells.
Confocal microscopes and DNA staining let us create 3D images of their DNA
similar to that in Fig. 1.</p>
<p>An animal cell cycles through four stages of development: growth (G1),
synthesize new DNA (S), more growth (G2), and splitting or mitosis (M).
Staining applies a reagent doped with a fluorescent molecule that binds to a desired target.
It is possible to determine which cells are in a certain phase by
staining them with the corresponding reagent; unfortunately, using multiple stains
causes complications.</p>
<p><strong>The goal of this project</strong> is to use the DNA shape to classify the cell's phase.</p>
<p>The procedure:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Stain cell DNA and one phase.</p></li>
<li><p>Image worms using a <a class="reference external" href="http://toutestquantique.fr/en/fluorescent-and-confocal/">confocal microscope</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Segment the image into individual cells.</p></li>
<li><p>Run a variety of image processing filters on the microscopy image to create a feature vector.</p></li>
<li><p>Partition data into training, validation, and test sets.</p></li>
<li><p>Train a support vector machine on the training set.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimize parameters on the validation set.</p></li>
<li><p>Test its accuracy on the test set.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The code I inherited was a case study in poor programming practices:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>No documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Inconsistent indentation</p></li>
<li><p>Significant code redundancy</p></li>
<li><p>Fragile: changing the database selection criteria required modifying nearly every file in the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Matlab was a poor choice of languages for an image database and supervised learning algorithm.</p></li>
<li><p>Database key uniqueness issues</p></li>
</ul>
<p>During my limited time on the project, I made the following improvements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Created a git repository</p></li>
<li><p>Improved the directory structure: source code, data, documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Refactored the code to remove redundancy</p></li>
<li><p>Reindexed the database to accomodate project growth</p></li>
<li><p>Wrote a documenttion for future users</p></li>
<li><p>Improved prediction accuracy from 85% to 90%</p></li>

Atoms are the most common SPELL lasing medium, and lasers perturb the electrons surrounding atoms.
Atomic molecular and optical physicists study these interactions in depth to learn more
about nature, and to develop better lasers.</p>
<p>During my graduate work, I joined two computational scientists at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ornl.gov/">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>.
My science advisor, Predrag Krstic, was interested in modeling quantum mechanical phenomena
in short-pulse interactions.  My computation advisor, Robert Harrison, was interested in
creating a framework to empower scientists to take advantage of high performance computing (HPC).
Together, they helped me create a computational experiment simulating how single-electron atoms
(Hydrogen, $He^+$, $Li^{2+}$) responded to a strong, short laser pulse.  This research was
built on Robert Harrison's <a class="reference external" href="../madness.html">MADNESS</a> framework.
IMPROVE
Sometimes it was exciting to develop world-class techonolgy;
other times it was frustrating pausing science to improve the tool.</p>
<p>I wrote my <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Laser-atom-interactions-multiresolution-Nicholas-Vence/dp/3639713575">thesis</a> as a guide for those interested in computing strong laser-atom interactions.
In it, I discuss my project's motivation, review competing algorithms for non-perturbative,
laser-atom interactions, published my results, and outlined the potential future directions
one could take this project.</p>
<p>My <a class="reference external" href="../files/Vence01PRA.pdf">Physical Review A</a> publication was a proof of concept which accomplished the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>performed convergence studies to ensure self-consistency,</p></li>
<li><p>reproduced previously published results,</p></li>
<li><p>replicated an experimental pulse,</p></li>
<li><p>predicted an array of two-photon ionization effects,</p></li>
<li><p>demonstrated the flexibility of our code by modeling a 4D molecular hydrogen ion $H_2^+$
where we treated the internuclear coordinate on the same computational footing as the electron.</p></li>
